### Overview

Cat To 10 is an Android app designed to curb cyber-bullying by warning users if their messages may be hurtful to the recipient before the messages are sent.

Users type a message and indicate a recipient, and when they send the message, Cat To 10 takes the message and searches it for offensive phrases, which are kept in an SQLite database. Each offensive phrase has an associated Anger Score, and the message to be sent is analyzed and given an overall Anger Score.
